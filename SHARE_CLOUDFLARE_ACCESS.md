# Share Cloudflare Access

## Quick Steps:

1. **Open this link**: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens

2. **Click "Create Token"**

3. **Select "Edit Cloudflare Workers" template** (or create custom with Pages permissions)

4. **Copy the token** (you'll only see it once!)

5. **Share the token with me** by pasting it here

## What I'll Do With The Token:

Once you share the token, I can:
- Create the Cloudflare Pages project
- Set environment variables (ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD)
- Deploy your application
- Configure the deployment settings

## Security Note:

The token gives me access to manage your Cloudflare Pages. You can revoke it anytime from the same page after we're done.

## Alternative: Wrangler Login

If you prefer, you can also run:
```bash
wrangler login
```

Then share:
- Your Cloudflare account email
- Confirmation that login worked

And I'll guide you through the deployment commands.
